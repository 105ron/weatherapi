# Engineering Coding Task Challenge

Instructions
The application needs to be written in NodeJS, which version is up to you, we currently like 8.9.11 for production, but don't let that limit your imagination.

*The application should:*
* either: require an argument that descibes the location we want the weather for and validates the provided argument oraccept interactive input to select the location we want the weather for.
* makes a request to a publicly available weather API, we like [openweathermap](api.openweathermap.org).
* process the response.
* Displays the weather for that location in an "interesting" way, your choice as to what you display, the outlook for thge next 7 days, detailed forecast for today, whatever go crazy.
* Not run in the browser.
